This is a tool for file carving. 

Instructions to run:
define the path for the CSV file as well as the file to be carved in the main.py file and run.
The output should be found in the same directory as the main.py.

The tool reads file headers and corresponding extensions from a csv file. 
Make sure that all headers in the CSV file are in lower case.
